=head1 NAME

Badger::Log::File - writes log messages to a log file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Badger::Log::File;
    
    my $log = Badger::Log::File->new({
        filename  => '/var/log/badger.log',
        keep_open => 1,
    });
        
    $log->log('a debug message');
    $log->info('an info message');
    $log->warn('a warning message');
    $log->error('an error message');
    $log->fatal('a fatal error message');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a subclass of L<Badger::Log> that implements a simple 
mechanism for logging messages to a file.  It uses L<Badger::Filesystem>
for all the underlying file operations.

=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

The following configuration options are available in addition to those
inherited form the L<Badger::Log> base class.

=head2 filename

The name of the log file which you want messages appended to.  This parameter
is mandatory.

=head2 filesystem

An optional reference to a L<Badger::Filesystem> object, or the name of a
filesystem class having a L<file()|Badger::Filesystem/file()> method similar
to that in L<Badger::Filesystem>. This defaults to the L<Badger::Filesystem>
class.

=head2 keep_open

A flag indicating if the log file should be kept open between calls to 
logging methods.  The default value is C<0> meaning that the file will be 
opened for each message and closed again afterwards.  Set it to any true 
value to have the file kept open.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are implemented in addition to those inherited
from L<Badger::Log> and its base classes.

=head2 log($level,$message)

This method redefines the L<log()|Badger::Log/log()> method in 
L<Badger::Log> to write logging messages to the log file.

=head2 INTERNAL METHODS

=head2 init(\%config)

Custom initialiser method which calls the base class
L<init_log()|Badger::Log/init_log()> method followed by the L<init_file()>
method.

=head2 init_file(\%config)

Custom initialiser method which handles the configuration and initialisation
of the file-specific parts of the logger.

=head2 acquire()

This method acquires a file handle (an L<IO::File> object) for the specified
L<filename>, opened ready for appending log messages. 

=head2 release()

The method releases a previously acquired file handle.  i.e. it closes the
log file.
