NAME
    Badger::Changes - Summary of changes in the Badger toolkit

CHANGES
    This document contains a brief overview of what has changed between
    successive version of the Badger toolkit.

    Mr T is our badger mascot. He no longer pities the fool that uses Badger
    in a production system. Which is a roundabout way of saying that Badger
    is now stable, reliable, and unlikely to change significantly in future
    versions.

    Badger is already being deployed in commercial production systems that
    I've built and I wouldn't be doing that if I wasn't 99.9% certain of its
    suitability and fitness for purpose. There are no guarantees of course,
    but it may help you to sleep at night knowing that I have a heavily
    vested interest in keeping the Badger fit and healthy.

  Version 0.07
    Added Badger::Storage and Badger::Storage::Filesystem.

    Added Badger::Codec::TT.

    Added the permissions() method to Badger::Filesystem::Path. Added
    temp_directory() and temp_file() methods to Badger::Filesystem.

    Added some extra comparison methods to Badger::Timestamp (not_equal(),
    (not_before() and not_after()) and overloaded these and other methods
    onto the "==", "!=", "<", ">", "<=" and ">=" operators.

    Added the export_before() and export_after() methods to
    Badger::Exporter.

    Added the if_env import hook and "-a|Badger::Test/all()" option to
    Badger::Test to make it easier to define tests that don't get run unless
    a particular environment variable is set (e.g. for Pod coverage/kwalitee
    tests that you only want to run if either of the "RELEASE_TESTING" or
    "AUTOMATED_TESTING" environment variables is set).

    Added the random_name() and camel_case() functions to Badger::Utils.
    Also add some extra debugging code to params() and self_params() to
    catch any attempt to pass an odd number of arguments.

    Added the debugf() and debug_at() methods to Badger::Debug.

    Added the auto_can() method to Badger::Class::Methods.

  Version 0.06
    Added copy_file() and move_file() to Badger::Filesystem and copy() and
    move() methods to Badger::Filesystem::File.

    Added chmod_path() to Badger::Filesystem and chmod() to
    Badger::Filesystem::Path.

    Added Bin() to Badger::Filesystem.

    Added the encoding() method to Badger::Filesystem::File for specifying
    the encoding of a file, along with the utf8(), bytes(), crlf() and raw()
    methods for enabling different encoding layers.

    Added the codec() method to Badger::Filesystem::File for specifying a
    serialisation codec to use in conjunction with the new data() method.

    Added Badger::Timestamp. This is returned by the new created(),
    accessed() and modified() methods in Badger::Filesystem::Path.

    Added Badger::Logic.

    Added Badger::Log and Badger::Log::File.

    Added numlike() to Badger::Utils as an alias for "looks_like_number".
    It's the numerical counterpart to textlike() and is significantly easier
    to type.

    Added debug_msg() to Badger::Base. Also added the "Badger::Base::Trial"
    class definition for use with the try() method.

    Added lib import hook to Badger.

    Added bclass as an alias for class in Badger::Class.

    Changed Badger::Class::Config to maintain the order of configuration
    parameters where possible (i.e. when expressed as a list ref rather than
    a hash ref). Also added "target:var" fallback which looks in the target
    object or hash ref for the variable. This allows options to default to
    the values set by preceeding options.

    Changed Badger::Codec::JSON to use JSON::XS if available.

    Mr T is now using Badger 0.06 in production code and is happy to report
    that everything seems to be working rather well. Anyone for a game of
    tennis?

  Version 0.05 - 23rd December 2008
    Refactored Badger::Factory.

    Added support to Badger::Exporter for the "=" pseudo-sigil which can be
    used to create constants on the fly.

        package Badger::Example;
        use Badger::Class
            exports => {
                tags => {
                    math => {
                        e   => '=2.718',
                        pi  => '=3.142',
                        phi => '=1.618',
                    },
                }
            };
        
    package main;
        use Badger::Example ':math';
        
    print e;            # 2.718
        print pi;           # 3.142
        print phi;          # 1.618

    Mr T is starting to feel rather confident about building a production
    system based on Badger v0.05.

  Version 0.04 - 2nd December 2008
    Added the throw_msg() method to Badger::Base.

    Added init_method hook to Badger::Class and initialiaser() to
    Badger::Class::Methods.

    Changed Badger::Exception match_type() method to accept a list or hash
    reference, or a string of whitespace delimited exception types.

    Changed Badger::Factory to pass $name as an argument to various methods.
    Also passes arguments to load() (required for Template::TT2::Plugins)
    Also modified item() to accept a non-textlike type argument which
    bypasses the module lookup.

    Moved a whole bunch of stuff out of Badger::Class into
    "Badger::Class::*" modules.

    Added Badger::Class::Config for simple configuration.

    Added hash() method to Badger::Methods and hash_methods hook to
    Badger::Class.

    Added trace() hook and related paraphernalia to Badger::Exception. Added
    the "-t" / "--trace" command line options to Badger::Test to enable it
    when running tests. Also added "-h" / "--help" options.

    Added Codec() exportable subroutine to Badger::Codecs.

    Added Badger::Codec::URL. It's similar to Badger::Codec::URI, but
    slightly different. See the TT uri/url filters for the reason.

    Changed the prototype() method in Badger::Prototype to accept a single
    "undef" value to clear any current prototype. Also added the
    has_prototype() method.

    Mr T is looking on the bright side about the possibility of building a
    production system based on Badger v0.04, but still advises caution.

  Version 0.03 - 7th October 2008
    Added delegate loaders to Badger. This provides some semantic sugar for
    loading a bunch of different "Badger::*" modules in one go.

        use Badger
            Filesystem  => 'FS $Bin',
            Codecs      => 'storable base64',
            Debug       => {
                modules => 'My::Module',
            };

    Added different() to Badger::Test::Manager.

    Added textlike() to Badger::Utils

    Added the overload as_text and is_true import hooks and related method
    to Badger::Class. These delegate to the "overload" module.

    Added the print method to Badger::Filesystem::File.

    Added support for dynamic root directories to
    Badger::Filesystem::Virtual.

    Added the defaults and aliases hooks to Badger::Class, implemented by
    Badger::Class::Defaults and Badger::Class::Aliases, respectively. There
    are still experimental.

    Fixed up some stat handling in Badger::Filesystem to help with
    subclassing in Badger::Filesystem::Virtual

    Mr T pities the fool that attempts to builds a production system based
    on Badger version 0.03 without first evaluating it carefully and reading
    the documentation.

  Version 0.02 - 6th September 2008
    Badger::Class got the vars method and hook for declaring and defining
    variables.

    Badger::Utils gained the ability to load and export functions from
    Scalar::Util, List::Util, List::MoreUtils, Hash::Util and Digest::MD5.

    Various documentation updates.

    Mr T admires the tenacity of anyone attempting to build a production
    system based on Badger v0.02 and hopes they have a thorough test suite.

  Version 0.01 - 27th August 2008
    This was the first release version.

    Mr T pities the fool who builds a production system based on Badger
    v0.01.
